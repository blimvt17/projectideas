TREE: frequently-used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure 
	-each node will have a ROOT VALUE and a list of REFERENCES to other nodes
	-these other nodes are called Child nodes
BINARY TREE: one of the most typical tree structure, 
	-EACH node has at MOST TWO children (referred to as left child and right child)

PRE-ORDER TRAVERSAL:
	1. visit the root  
	2. traverse left subtree 
	3. traverse right subtree
IN-ORDER TRAVERSAL: 
	1. traverse left subtree 
	2. visit the root 
	3. traverse right subtree
POST-RDER TRAVERSAL:
	1. traverse left subtree
	2. traverse right subtree
	3. visit the root 
	- when you delete nodes in a tree, deletion process will be in post-order
