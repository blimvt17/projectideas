- Summary: Practicing Python by building projects 


## List of projects

### In Progress
- [ ] **rock_paper_scissors_game.py** : create a rps game 
- [ ] **letter_counter.py** : count # of the characters 'a' or 'A' from a sentence  
- [x] **dice_roller.py** : create a dice with numbers 1-6, roll the dice for how many times user wants and prints the results for each number to the console 
- [ ] **random_number_probability.py** : prints the probability of numbers based on two user inputs; max_number, number_of_generations
- [x] **factorial.py** : gets an integer from user and returns the factorial result 
- [x] **multiplication_table.py** : Nested for loop. create a multiplication table, print the results to the console
- [x] **palindrome_checker.py** - create a function that checks if input string is a palindrome or not

### ideas

- [ ] Find the highest number in the list - given 100 numbers, store them in a list, and find the highest number
- [ ] Password Validator - using while loop, ask user to provide a password until it matches the expected password
- [ ] Swap the values - swap the values of the two variables of type integer
- [ ] find the prime numbers from 1-100 and print them to the console
- [ ] youtube_from_terminal
- [ ] Google_news
- [ ] create a function that returns a boolean by searching the directory if the file exists
### practice
- [ ] **recursion_prac.py**: practicing recursion and memoized solutions of a problem
